>Way back in 2006 (20 years ago!), I released [ImageManager 2.0](assets/imagemnager-2006.md), a popular WordPress plugin for image management and editing. Virtual Media Folders is my modern take on media organization for WordPress, built with React and modern tooling.

## Description

Virtual Media Folders brings folder organization to your WordPress Media Library. Organize your media files into hierarchical folders **without moving files on disk**—folders are virtual, so your URLs never change.

### AI Abilities

Virtual Media Folders exposes Abilities API tools that can be used by AI agents and MCP adapters.

- **`vmfo/list-folders`** (read-only): Lists folders with `id`, `name`, `parent_id`, `path`, and `count`.
- **`vmfo/create-folder`** (write): Creates a folder with `name` and optional `parent_id`.
- **`vmfo/add-to-folder`** (write): Adds one or more attachments to a folder using `folder_id` and `attachment_ids`.

Recommended flow for AI clients:

1. Call `vmfo/list-folders` to resolve folder names and paths to a stable `id`.
2. If needed, call `vmfo/create-folder` to create the target folder.
3. Call `vmfo/add-to-folder` with that `folder_id` and one or more `attachment_ids`.

This avoids ambiguity when folder names are duplicated under different parents.

Permission model:

- `vmfo/list-folders` and `vmfo/add-to-folder` require the `upload_files` capability.
- `vmfo/create-folder` requires the `manage_categories` capability.

	-u "username:application-password" \
	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}'

# Resolve folder id via gateway
curl -X POST "https://example.com/wp-json/mcp/mcp-adapter-default-server" \
	-u "username:application-password" \
	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"mcp-adapter-execute-ability","arguments":{"ability_name":"vmfo/list-folders","parameters":{"search":"travel","hide_empty":false}}}}'

# Add attachments to folder via gateway
