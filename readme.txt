Virtual folder organization and intelligent management for the WordPress Media Library, without altering file locations on disk.

== Description ==

Virtual Media Folders brings virtual folder organization to your WordPress Media Library. Organize your media files into hierarchical folders without moving files on disk—folders are virtual, so your URLs never change.

= Features =

* **Virtual Folders** – Create hierarchical folder structures to organize media
* **Drag & Drop** – Easily move media between folders with drag and drop
* **Sticky Sidebar** – Folder navigation stays visible while scrolling through media
* **Gutenberg Integration** – Filter media by folder directly in the block editor
* **Bulk Actions** – Move multiple media items at once
* **Keyboard Accessible** – Full keyboard navigation support
* **Internationalized** – Ready for translation (Norwegian Bokmål included)

= Free add-ons =

[**Add-On Manager**](https://github.com/soderlind/vmfa) lets you easily install and manage add-ons that extend Virtual Media Folders with powerful new features:

* [**AI Organizer**](https://github.com/soderlind/vmfa-ai-organizer) – Uses vision-capable AI models to analyze actual image content and automatically organize your media library into virtual folders. This is add-on functionality requiring an API key from a supported AI service provider, or a local LLM.
* [**Editorial Workflow**](https://github.com/soderlind/vmfa-editorial-workflow) – Role-based folder access, move restrictions, and Inbox workflow.
* [**Folder Exporter**](https://github.com/soderlind/vmfa-folder-exporter) – Export folders (or subtrees) as ZIP archives with optional CSV manifests.
* [**Media Cleanup**](https://github.com/soderlind/vmfa-media-cleanup) – Tools to identify and clean up unused or duplicate media files.
* [**Rules Engine**](https://github.com/soderlind/vmfa-rules-engine) – Rule-based automatic folder assignment for media uploads, based on metadata, file type, or other criteria.

= How It Works =

Virtual Media Folders uses a custom taxonomy to assign media to folders. This means:

* Your media files stay exactly where they are on the server
* URLs never change when you reorganize
* Folders can be nested to create hierarchies

= Usage =

**Organizing Media**

1. Go to **Media > Library**
2. Click the folder icon to show the sidebar
3. Use **+** to create folders
4. Drag media onto folders to organize / Bulk select media and use the "Move to Folder" action
5. Click a folder to filter the view

**Settings**

Go to **Media > Folder Settings** to configure:

* **Show "All Media"** – Display "All Media" option in sidebar
* **Show "Uncategorized"** – Display folder for unassigned media
* **Jump to folder after move** – Navigate to target folder after moving
* **Default folder for uploads** – Auto-assign new uploads to a folder

**Block Editor**

When inserting media from a block (Image, Gallery, etc.):

1. Open the Media Library modal
2. Use the folder sidebar to filter
3. Select your media as usual

== Installation ==

= From WordPress Plugin Directory =

1. Go to Plugins → Add New in your WordPress admin
2. Search for "Virtual Media Folders"
3. Click "Install Now" and then "Activate"

==  Screenshots ==

1. Folder sidebar in Media Library
2. Settings page
3. Bulk move action
4. Gutenberg media modal integration

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this move my actual files? =

No. Virtual Media Folders uses virtual folders. Your files stay exactly where they are on the server, and all URLs remain unchanged.

= Can I nest folders? =

Yes! You can create hierarchical folder structures with unlimited nesting levels.

= Does this work with Gutenberg? =

Yes! When inserting media in the block editor, you can filter by folder using the sidebar in the Media Library modal.

= Can I assign media to multiple folders? =

No, each media item belongs to one folder at a time. Moving media to a new folder removes it from the previous folder.

= What happens if I delete a folder? =

Only the folder organization is removed. Your media files are not deleted.

= Is this compatible with my theme? =

Virtual Media Folders works entirely within the WordPress admin. It doesn't affect your front-end theme.
